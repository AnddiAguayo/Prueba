J: Hi my son! are you OK?

L: Yes, but I want to tell you about the behavior of my sister and her friend.

J: What's the problem with them?

L: I saw Carla and Yola kissing on my way to school!
J: Are you sure?

L: Yes, I'm sure!

J: I have had many conversations with you and your sister, at least three times about the sexuality.

   And you  never had told me nothing of your sexual preferences.

   But don't worry might be you have a bad interpretation of their behavior.
   What do you think about them?, they're lesbians?, aren't you agree with your sister?

Other day..
C: Hey Diana! What do you think happened?!
D: What?
C: The other day my brother saw us and I worry about what will he said to my dad.
D: And your dad didn't known about us?
C: No. I've been thinking about how to tell him
D: Don't worry, there must be a way to tell him. 
   Why don't we call Andrea, probably she can help us.
C: Lets call her.

A: Hi Carla. How are you?
C: A little bit bad, I have a problem with my dad about the relationship that
   I have with Diana.
A: What problem?
C: The other day my brother saw us and I'm sure he will said to my dad
   about my relationship with Diana, but my dad didn't known about that
A: I understand. Don't worry Carla.
   Go with your dad and tell him about your relationship.
   Explain what your feelings towards Diana and tell him not to feel bad or
   ashamed of you, he should take that relationship as normal and support you.
C: Thank you Andrea for your help.
